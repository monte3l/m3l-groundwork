# Refactoring rules (source & tests)

> This file is the terse checklist that auto-loads when you change existing code.

Refactoring changes internal structure **without changing observable behavior**.
It is not feature, performance, or behavior work — those are separate commits.

- **Test safety net first.** A passing suite must exist before you refactor; if the
  area lacks tests, **add characterization tests** capturing current behavior first.
- **State the goal.** Name the problem you are removing (duplication, complexity,
  naming, weak types). No identified problem → no refactor.
- **Small isolated steps**, each one focused operation, **committed individually**
  with a `refactor:` commit. Rerun the full suite after each
  step; a failure is a regression — revert before continuing.
- **Opportunistic / Boy-Scout:** leave touched code better than you found it, and
  do a preparatory refactor first when it makes the change you came to do simpler —
  but **keep it bounded** (don't chase one cleanup into a rewrite) and in its own
  commit, separate from the feature/fix.
- **A refactor MUST NOT** add features, change observable behavior, add a
  dependency, or change a public interface unless that is the explicit purpose.
- **Semver hazard:** changing an exported signature or the `exports` map is a
  breaking change, not a free refactor — keep the public surface stable or plan
  the major bump. New capability surfaces through the existing barrel/entry
  point, never a new subpath added casually.
- **Tests are production code:** rename a test when its behavior is renamed, delete
  tests that no longer assert a contract, refactor a shared fixture once (not every
  caller), and update a mock target the moment the impl's I/O primitive changes (a
  stale mock silently intercepts nothing).
- **Moving code out from under a test can leave it vacuous with no gate
  catching it.** Extracting or relocating the behavior a test exercises,
  without re-deriving what the test still actually reaches, can leave it
  green while asserting nothing real — and a fixture edited to match the new
  code is not automatically a test of the behavior that changed; confirm it
  still fails when the new behavior is wrong, not just that it passes when
  the code is right.
- **A full test-file rewrite must name what it must NOT touch.** A general
  instruction ("don't drop tests for unchanged functions") is easy to satisfy
  partially in a large rewrite without anyone noticing which specific cases got
  lost — enumerate the functions whose existing coverage must survive
  untouched, not just restate the rule.
- **Removing a lint suppression cannot be its own commit.** `reportUnusedDisableDirectives:
"error"` (`eslint.config.js`) makes a stale `eslint-disable-next-line` a lint error
  the instant the finding it suppressed no longer fires — so the change that
  clears the underlying issue and the deletion of its suppression comment must
  land in the same commit, never split across two.
