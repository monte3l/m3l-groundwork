/**
 * SessionStart (matcher `compact|resume|startup`): reads the handoff
 * artifact `write-compact-handoff.mjs` (`PreCompact`) wrote and re-injects
 * it as `additionalContext` -- so state reconstruction doesn't depend on the
 * summary having retained it, whether the next session started because of a
 * compaction, a `--resume`/`--continue`, or a fresh `startup` that inherits
 * a worktree an earlier, since-killed session left dirty.
 *
 * `resume`/`startup` are included alongside `compact` because a
 * `compact`-only registration would leave a handoff written by a
 * `PreCompact` whose session was then killed (crash, OOM, Ctrl-C) sitting
 * in `tmp/` forever -- the next session, on any source, would never see it.
 * `SessionEnd` has no guaranteed abnormal-termination signal, so the fix is
 * on this read side, not a new write-side hook.
 *
 * A `resume`/`startup` read has no one-compaction freshness guarantee the
 * way a `compact` read does (it may be reading a handoff several sessions
 * old), so `formatHandoff` flags anything older than 24h as likely stale.
 *
 * Advisory-only: always exits 0. A missing or unreadable artifact (first
 * compaction ever, or the write hook failed) means nothing to inject --
 * silently no-op rather than surfacing a confusing "handoff not found"
 * line every time the artifact is legitimately absent.
